    <p>
        We work with one guiding principle.
        Keep it simple stupid.
        It’s an eternal reminder that keeps us in check and reminds us what branding in essence needs to be.
        Tell your potential suitors who you are in a compelling, but compact way. 
        Don’t overcomplicate things and communicate your stoy with confidence.
        This is the basis on which Rosen+Branding operates.
